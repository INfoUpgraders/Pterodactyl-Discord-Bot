# How to get started
- First what you need to get is your Pterodactyl Panel link and place it in the `PANEL_LINK` [section of the code](/bot.py). Don't forget to include the `http(s)://` on the link either.
- You need to obtain your **super secret _applcation_ API** by doing: 
  - a. Make sure you are in the Panel under _Admin Mode_ and head over to the `Application API` section to the left.
     b. Click `Create New`
